# Hands-On App Development with Ionic
This is the code repository for Learning Splunk. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
	
While Ionic is an easy and straightforward framework to learn, building Ionic apps can sometimes be hard. Designing its architecture and making sure that your application is high-performing, dynamic, and scalable are always tricky.

In this course, you will develop a feature-rich Notes app in a step-by-step process using the Ionic framework. You will be using web components, persistent storage, and APIs to ensure your app is high- performing. You'll use the MobX reactive state management tool to make your apps scalable. You'll then use a SQLite database to persist data onto your device.

With the Ionic Native Camera API, you'll add, save pictures to your notes then edit and save them, set reminders in your notes, and have your device notify you of events using Ionic Native local notifications. You will deploy your app across iOS and Android devices and also on the web.

By the end of the course, you will have taken your Ionic 4 and 5 skills to the next level and will be equipped to build cross-platform hybrid mobile apps.
